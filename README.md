This repository holds the source for this Specification, part of the family of [Networked Media Open Specifications](https://specs.amwa.tv/nmos) from the [Advanced Media Workflow Association](https://amwa.tv)

<!-- INTRO-START -->

### What does the series do?

- The BCP-006 series of AMWA Best Common Practices define how to connect Endpoints using AMWA IS-04 and IS-05 for various stream protocols and formats, including:
  - Specification of the resources and attributes used for the stream protocol/format.
  - Requirements for the Transport File (such as SDP).
  - Examples.

### Why does it matter?

- The individual mapping BCPs ensure consistency between implementations offering NMOS for each stream protocol/format.
- Bringing these together in the BCP-006 series helps provide consistency between the individual mappings and provides an index of mappings.

### What are the mappings?

[BCP-006-01](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-006-01): NMOS With JPEG XS
