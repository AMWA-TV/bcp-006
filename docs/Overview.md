## Introduction

Although (as of 2021) AMWA IS-04/05 and the other NMOS Specifications have been mainly been used in ST 2110 environments, they have always been capable of supporting other streaming protocols and formats. BCP-006 is an extensible series of Stream Mappings specifying how to use NMOS for individual protocols and formats. 

The first mapping, [BCP-006-01](https://specs.amwa.tv/bcp-006-01) is for JPEG XS.
